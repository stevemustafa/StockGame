** Still incomplete, have to finish when I am free **

This is a Stock market simulation game, which is still incomplete. However, now that the bug has bitten, I'll be sure to complete it. Things on my to do list include:

*Creating a state where user and "market" data are stored in a database
*Allowing for multi-tenancy
*Creating a much larger commodity base
*Use Hidden Markov Models so as to effect commodity on commodity interactions

That said, the easiest way to get all that you need to get you going is to clone the repo off of [github](https://github.com/stevemustafa/stockgame), then run "npm install" to install the needed dependencies. You can then run it by "node index.js".

Please note, this has only been tested on Linux and I would consider this to be in the early alpha versions, its an OK proof of concept, sufficient to explore my abilities [somewhat, I still have more tricks up my sleeve :-) ].

Please feel free to contact me by email at <steven.i.mustafa@gmail.com> or by Phone at (587).703.8841

My best wishes,




Steve Mustafa
